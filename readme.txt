The data files are present in data as MATLAB.mat files,
 the data processing stage in this model needs to be done using the MATLAB code Idear2_Main.m,
 in which the kriging super-resolution calculations are done with the help of the sufer26 software,
 the deep learning model is done using the python code, 
and the noise reduction module is done using the MATLAB code.
